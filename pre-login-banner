How to Set It Up (Linux / SSH)

Edit the banner file (e.g., /etc/issue.net):

Bash

Copier le code
sudo nano /etc/issue.net
Paste your custom message there.

Enable the banner in SSH config:

Bash

Copier le code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Find or add:


Copier le code
Banner /etc/issue.net
Restart SSH service:

Bash

Copier le code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
If you want, I can create three different styles of banner messages — from formal legal tone to friendly but firm — so you can choose the one that fits your server’s personality.
Do you want me to prepare those?
